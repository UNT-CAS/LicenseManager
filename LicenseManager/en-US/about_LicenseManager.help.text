SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Manage concurrent usage of software that doesn't use a smarter license server, such as Flex LM.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    We have several pieces of software that don't use a license server. Because of this, we own n number of stand-alone licenses.
    When applicable, we can install this on as many computers as we want, such as in a VDI farm, and make it availble as long as we can control concurrency.
    This is an attempt to control concurrency in these situations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

    This is an attempt to control concurrency in these situations.

    I prefer to run this as a scheduled task that triggers at reboot and re-runs every 15 minutes or so; ensure:

    - If it's already running, another one doesn't startup.
    - It's never forced to die after a timeout.

    This ensure that the process is always running. If it dies for some reason, we'll get it running again within 15 minutes
